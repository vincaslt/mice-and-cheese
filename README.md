An open-source experimentational game created using Java with Slick2D game library, Artemis Entity Component System and Nifty-GUI.

Dependencies need to be linked in IDE, also, VM options under Run Configurations must point to native libraries for LWJGL.
The steps are the same as described in the wiki:

set VM options to: -Djava.library.path=lib\natives\windows

or change to where the native libraries actually are, if somethting was changed.


I can't figure out how to export .jar without hastle... Some files need to be imported into .jar manually it seems.
